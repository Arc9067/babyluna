                <h3>About <span class="special">Baby Luna?</span></h3>
                <p>There was a wolf named Luna , he got attacked by evil humans trying to make money out of its hide and bones, the cowardly human whales planned carefully and teamed up against the lone luna in one swift attack, although luna has many disciples their paper hands faltered against such an unexpected attack and Most of them shit their pants and ran away with their tails between their legs . 
                    Luna got injured and fell sick and weak.   No longer capable of fighting alone and with his wife pregnant, all his hopes rested on his child baby luna.
                    Even though most disciples ran away during the attack many true believers stayed nearby, waiting for a chance to fight back a chance to take revenge.  Discovering Baby Luna was like a ray of sunshine and hope for these former paperhanded hardened disciples, they swore to never sell and stand and fight for their right to WAGMI, Baby luna became the symbol of their mission and revenge. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Baby Luna has a Mission to keep legacy of luna alive and uses luna coins to reward its disciples and loyal soldiers. 
                    Baby Luna will take revenge for its mother Luna against the evil human Whales that attacked it and destroyed its home.

                <h3>Why <span class="special special2">Baby Luna</span></h3>
                <p>Baby Luna will be different from other projects with NO private sale and NO presale that allocates tokens to investors. Without a presale, there will be no tokens allocated before launch and resulting in more tokens available in supply to give an fair opportunity for all investors. The benefit of no private/presale token allocations means no token dumps at launch.</p>
